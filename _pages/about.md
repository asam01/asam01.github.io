I am a third-year PhD student in the AI Lab at the University of Michigan, where I am advised by [Prof. Emily Mower Provost](https://emp.engin.umich.edu/). Before that, I received my B.S. in Artificial Intelligence from Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science, where I was advised by [Prof. Louis-Philippe Morency](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~morency/).

I work on Natural Language Processing and Speech Processing in the context of emotional and social intelligence in AI. Specifically, I have worked on (1) speech emotion recognition [ICASSP 2025](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10889878) and (2) emotion evidence benchmarking [AACL 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03490). I am interested in expanding this research to improve human-agent interaction.
