This page contains the projects I am currently working on.

Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis
------
*This project is in collaboration with Procter & Gamble's Data Science & AI group.* In this project, I am developing novel pipelines for aspect-based sentiment analysis to provide structured and actionable summaries of free-form, unstructured product review videos.

Emotion Recognition from Unstructured Speech
------
*This project is in collaboration with Butler Hospital's psychiatry group.* In this project, I am developing modeling techniques to predict daily self-report emotion measures from participant's in-the-wild, personal phone calls.

Disentangling Dimensional Emotion in Self-Supervised Audio Encoders
------
In this project, I am analyzing the entanglement between the *activation* (calm-excited) and *valence* (negative-positive) latent spaces when using traditional finetuning techniques on self-supervised audio encoders. I am exploring methods to disentangle these dimensions for more effective modeling.
